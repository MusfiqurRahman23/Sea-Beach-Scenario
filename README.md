## Sea Beach Scenario Project

This project is developed using OpenGL and GLUT (OpenGL Utility Toolkit) in the CodeBlocks IDE. It showcases a sea beach scenario with realistic graphics and interactive elements. Below, you'll find a guide on setting up the project and running it successfully.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following software installed:

1. CodeBlocks IDE: A free, open-source IDE that supports C/C++ programming.
2. OpenGL and GLUT libraries: These libraries are required for creating and running OpenGL applications.

## Setup Instructions

To set up and run the Sea Beach Scenario Project, follow these steps:

1. Open CodeBlocks and create a new project.
2. Choose a "Console Application" template and select "C" as the programming language.
3. Save the project with a suitable name (e.g., "SeaBeachProject").
4. Download the OpenGL and GLUT libraries for your operating system and compiler. Make sure to select the correct version (32-bit or 64-bit) based on your system configuration.
5. Extract the downloaded libraries to a suitable location on your computer.
6. Open the project properties in CodeBlocks by right-clicking on the project name in the workspace and selecting "Build options."
7. In the "Compiler settings" tab, click on "Linker settings."
8. Add the OpenGL and GLUT library files to the project by clicking on the "Add" button and navigating to the extracted library folder.
9. Select the necessary library files (e.g., `opengl32`, `glu32`, `glut32`), and click "Open" to add them to the project.
10. Click "OK" to save the changes and close the project properties.
11. Now, in the project workspace, right-click on the main file (usually named `main.c` or `main.cpp`) and select "Open."
12. Replace the existing code with the Sea Beach Scenario Project code, which can be found in the project's source files.

## Running the Project

To run the Sea Beach Scenario Project, follow these steps:

1. Make sure all the necessary libraries are correctly linked to the project (as explained in the setup instructions).
2. Build the project by clicking on the "Build" button or selecting "Build and Run" from the "Build" menu.
3. If the project compiles successfully without any errors, the executable file will be generated in the project's output folder.
4. Locate the generated executable file (usually inside the project's "bin" folder).
5. Double-click the executable file to run the Sea Beach Scenario Project.
6. The project's window will open, showcasing the sea beach scenario with interactive elements.
7. Interact with the project using the keyboard and mouse as specified in the project instructions.

## Project Features

The Sea Beach Scenario Project includes the following features:

1. Realistic rendering of a sea beach environment.
2. Dynamic lighting effects to simulate the sun's position and day-night cycle.
3. Interactive objects, such as palm trees, sandcastles, and seagulls.
4. User interaction using keyboard and mouse controls.
5. Sound effects to enhance the immersive experience.
6. Customizable options to adjust graphics settings, audio, and more.

Feel free to explore and modify the project code to add additional features or customize the scenario to your liking.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues while setting up or running the project, consider the following troubleshooting steps:

1. Double-check that you have correctly linked the OpenGL and GLUT libraries to the project.
2. Verify that your OpenGL and GLUT libraries are compatible with your operating system and compiler.
3. Ensure that your graphics card drivers are up to date.
